# Stackline Take Home Assement
Completed by Tanner Harrison - June 25, 2024

## Solution

The implemented solution uses
* Typescript
* Redux Toolkit - note here, I did not feel that the size of this application necessarily needed a full blown state management solution. I implemented all of the skeleton, but I only connected the components that I felt like needed to be tied into the state.
* MUI for basic components
* ChartJS for the graph
* Code as clean as I felt like I could get given the time constraints. If I had more time, I would have liked to spend more time doing fewer inline css styles and using more css classes. Given the size of the application though, I felt like inline css styles were easier to implment and maintain. As more html elements that need to be styled similarly are added, I would like to spend more time doing more css classes.
